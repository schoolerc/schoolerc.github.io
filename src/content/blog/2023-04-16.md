# "Hello World"

The intent of this will be to act as a blog and as a platform for hosting any front-end only demos,
proof-of-concepts, portfolio type things, etc. This entire thing itself will also be a learning experience. At the time of writing this, my front end skills are still one of the weaker aspects of my skillset, so it seemed like an opportunity. If anyone else can take something away from looking at what I make, then even better.

## What's under the hood

This is all hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the primary content engine is [Astro](https://astro.build/).
I'll be taking advantage of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for convenience primarily. Other demos and such will use whatever makes sense at the time of creating them. Likely using Vue3 for now since that's a focus with my current employment.

## What's to come

The next chunk of time I spend on this will likely go towards the root page's layout, styling, and links; and scaffolding
the structure of the demo section. I intend to make individual posts when I create/push changes to any of the demos on the site as well
as using them as traditional blog posts.
